          <li>I am a Paula. Thanks to LinguaSphere, I am ready to work in Belgium!
             Let me tell you how:
             I had worked for 10 years as Pharmacist in Argantina before I moved to Belgium.
             My Dutch level is C1 which is pretty enough for any job opportunity in the market yet
             I didnot have the courege to apply any job application due to lack of mondeling skills.
             Also I needed to learn the Pharmaceutical Terms in Dutch which is not thought
             in language courses. With LinguaSphere I have found 2 Pharmacist that matched my profile.
             I have made my language-intern with one of them and now I am ready for real work!</li>
