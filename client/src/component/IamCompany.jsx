                    I am a Paula. Thanks to LinguaSphere, I am ready to work in
                    Belgium!
                    <br />
                    Let me tell you how: I had worked for 10 years as Pharmacist
                    in Argantina before I moved to Belgium. My Dutch level is C1
                    which is pretty enough for any job opportunity in the market
                    yet I didnot have the courege to apply any job application
                    due to lack of mondeling skills. Also I needed to learn the
                    Pharmaceutical Terms in Dutch which is not thought in
                    language courses. With LinguaSphere I have found 2
                    Pharmacist that matched my profile. I have made my
                    language-intern with one of them and now I am ready for real
                    work!
